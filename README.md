## Tech Stack used

This web app is created in MERN stack with authentication using firebase, Currently it's deployed as Frontend on Vercel.com and backend on Render.com and database deployed on MongoDB atlas cloud.

## Usage

Once the app opens you have provide the correct details and you will recieve OTP on given Mobile, fill it up correctly, and you are all set to start preparing for sample tests provided.
