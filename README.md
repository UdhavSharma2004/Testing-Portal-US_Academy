Greetings! I am Udhav Sharma, a dedicated student at GZSCCET (2021-25). I take immense pride in presenting the Testing Portal Web App, a remarkable project born during my tenure as a Web Development Intern at Potencia Academy. This portal stands as a testament to my skills, creativity, and unwavering commitment to excellence.

## Technological Marvel

Embodied in the MERN stack, this web application is a fusion of cutting-edge technologies. The authentication is fortified by the robust Firebase framework. As you navigate through the portal, its frontend gracefully resides on the illustrious Vercel.com, while the backend, a true work of art, finds its home on Render.com. The database, elegantly sprawls across the MongoDB Atlas cloud.

## Seamless Experience

Embark on a journey of discovery and knowledge as you interact with this masterpiece. By following the link to the frontend provided below, you shall be ushered into a realm of learning and assessment. Please note, due to the eloquent frugality of our choices, the initial request might greet you with a brief pause lasting 45-60 seconds after 15 minutes of inactivity. A small price to pay for a transcendent experience. 

Once the portal graces your screen, diligently furnish the requisite details. Awaiting you is an OTP, a key to unlocking the treasures of preparation through sample tests that await your conquering spirit.
